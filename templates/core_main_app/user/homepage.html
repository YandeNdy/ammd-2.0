                    The Additive Manufacturing Materials Database (AMMD) is built using the NIST Material Data Curation System
                    (MDCS) as a backend with structure provided by NIST’s AM schema. Providing a collaboration platform, the
                    database is set to evolve through the open data access and material data sharing among the AM community. As
                    data sets continue to accumulate, it becomes possible to establish new correlations between processes,
                    materials, and parts.

                    The schema, or data structure, provides the backbone of the AMMD.  The relationships created by the
                    structure are essential to supporting meaningful data curation and data retrieval.  As the AMMD matures
                    through iterations, it is the data structure that will need to evolve to support the development of
                    meaningful relationships that can be used to query the database.

                    Since part design information and test data are linked to individual builds, we structure the data sets
                    into three types of main entities, as shown in Figure 1. The first entity type “amMaterial” captures vendor
                    material information. The second type of entity “amMachine” captures AM machine information. The data
                    captured by these two types are independent of specific builds and can be provided by material vendors and
                    machine owners. The third type of database entity “amBuild” captures the information related to a specific
                    AM build, including part and specimen design, pre-process, in-process and post process information, as well
                    as test information.
